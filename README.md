# Quaternion Exploration

## Project Overview
The **Quaternion Exploration** project provides interactive tools and visualizations for understanding quaternion algebra and its applications, particularly in 3D rotations and theoretical mechanics. The notebook uses IPython and the `manim` libraries to create interactive visualizations and numerical simulations.

## Features

1. **Quaternion Basics**  
   - Non-commutativity of quaternions and rotation representation.  
   - Insights into active and passive transformations.

## Requirements

### Software
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Installation of all necessary packages is done inside the notebook.

## How to Use

### Setup the Environment
- Run setup cells in Colab or ensure libraries are installed locally.


### Use Widgets

- Configure rotation parameters (angles, vectors) via sliders.
- Observe real-time visual outputs for transformations and quaternion compositions.

### Solve Dynamics
- Input initial quaternion and angular velocity functions to simulate quaternion evolution.
